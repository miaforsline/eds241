environmental outcomes of interest. Students will learn the research designs and methods for
estimating causal effects with experimental and non-experimental data. This will prepare the
students for interpreting and conducting high-quality empirical research, with applications in
cross-sectional data and panel data settings. Each concept will be introduced in class through
relevant real-world applications.
